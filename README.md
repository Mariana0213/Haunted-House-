# Haunted-House-
Group project for class 
For this project my classmates and I had to make a text based game. This project was for an Intro to Python class, where we are learning the basics. 
This is a game where you  a few of your friends have decided to stay in a small town on your way to a Halloween event. While eating at a diner you overhear that there is a house nearby that is supposedly haunted. Upon hearing this, your friends then say that you should visit the house. Even though you are hesitant you agree. After dropping off your things at the hotel you all head to the house and you start to question whether you should enter or not. The house is intimidating and with every approaching step it gets colder.
